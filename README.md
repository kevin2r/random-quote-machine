# Random Quote Machine

This is a "Free Code Camp" challenge where you have to build a Random Quote Machine.

The app has to have similar funcionality to this one -> [Example](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/)

While developing the app, I had to fulfill the requirements below:

* I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## How to run the app locally in your machine.

* Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Install "Bower" globally on your machine `npm install -g bower`
* Clone this repository on your machine
* `cd` into the folder and run `npm install`
* Run `bower install`
* Run `npm start`
* Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
